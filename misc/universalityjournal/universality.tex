\section{Introduction}
The behaviour of the Riemann zeta function on the critical axis is of interest to 
physicists~\cite{Shanker 2006} because of
its close connections  to the theory of the spectra of random matrix theories 
(RMT)~\cite{Wigner 1967, Gaudin 1960, Gaudin 1961, Dyson 1962} 
and the spectra of classically chaotic quantum systems in 
physics~\cite{Berry 1985,Berry 1986,Berry 1987,Berry 1988}. 
To get some insight into this, 
in this work
we look at the symmetry and universality properties of the Riemann zeta function 
on the critical axis.
The universality relations and symmetries exhibited by a system are fundamental aspects of the system. 
In this work, we present symmetry and universality relations for the value
distribution of the Riemann zeta function at Generalized Gram points.

Ref.~\cite{Shanker 2018a} studied empirically the distribution of $Z(t)$ values at 
Gram points and
showed  that the distribution for even Gram points was the negative  of the 
distribution for odd Gram points. 
Further work~\cite{Shanker 2018b}) extended the study to Generalized Gram points. 
The new results in this work are as follows. 
Our new universality relation (Eq.~\ref{eq:universality}) expresses the value distributions 
at different Generalized Gram points, in terms of three universal functions.
We show that the  value
distribution of the Hardy $Z$ function at discrete points is anti-symmetrical 
for reflections around the mid-points 
of the Gram intervals (Eq.~\ref{eq:rhoantisym}) and symmetrical for reflections 
around the Gram points(Eq.~\ref{eq:rhosym}). 

Section~\ref{sec2} establishes the required notation for the 
Riemann Zeta Function. 
Section~\ref{sec3} presents the conjectured universality and symmetry relations
and provides evidence for the universality relations.
In Section~\ref{sec4} we discuss the evidence for the symmetry relations
by studying the quantiles of the distributions.
Section~\ref{conclusions} presents the conclusions. In the Appendix we discuss
the nature of the probability distribution a little more in depth.

\section{\label{sec2}Notation for the Riemann zeta function}

In this section we  establish the required notation for the 
Riemann Zeta Function. 
For $\mathrm{Re} (s) > 1$ the Riemann Zeta function is defined as
\begin{equation}
\zeta ( s ) \, = \, \sum^{\infty}_{n = 1} \; n^{-s} \, = \, \prod_{p \in primes} \;
\left( 1 - p^{-s} \right)^{-1}.
\label{eqRie}
\end{equation}
 $\zeta ( s )$ can be continued to
the complex plane. Riemann's hypothesis, that the non-trivial zeros of $\zeta ( s )$ lie on the 
critical axis $1/2+it$, is probably the most famous unsolved problem in mathematics.
The mean spacing $\delta$ of the zeros  at large height $T$ is $\delta = 2\pi(\ln (T/2\pi))^{-1}$. 
For numerical studies of the Riemann hypothesis one defines Hardy's function
\begin{equation}
Z(t)=exp(i\theta(t))\zeta(1/2 +it) 
\label{eq:hardy}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\theta(t) = arg (\pi^{it/2} \Gamma(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{it}{2})). 
\label{eq:theta}
\end{equation}
The argument in Eq.~\ref{eq:theta} is defined by continuous variation of $t$ starting with the value $0$ at $t = 0$.
$Z(t)$ is real valued for real $t$,
and we have $|Z(t)| = |\zeta(1/2+it)|$. Thus the zeros of $Z(t)$ are the imaginary part of the zeros 
of $\zeta(s)$ which lie on the critical line.  

Gram points~\cite{Gram 1903} play an important role in the the theory because many of the zeros are separated by them.  When $t \ge 7$, the $\theta$ function Eq.(\ref{eq:theta}) is monotonic increasing. 
For $n \ge -1$, the $n$-th Gram point $g_n$ is defined as the unique solution $> 7$ to
$\theta (g_n) = n\pi$. A Gram interval is the interval $G_n = [g_n,g_{n+1})$.
 In analogy with Gram points, we can associate an angle $\phi$ with a point $t$ on the critical axis as follows:
\begin{definition}\label{phi}
For $t \ge 7$, $t$ is said to be a generalized Gram point with value $\phi$  if
$\theta (t) = 2k\pi + \phi$, where $0 \le \phi < 2\pi$.
\end{definition}

\end{table}

In this section we present the probability distribution function for the Riemann zeta function
values at Generalized Gram points. We present a universality relation satisfied by these distributions.

The sample space for our study is the interval along the critical axis specified by $(T_1, T_2)$. 
While empirical studies necessarily use large but finite  $T_1, T_2$, we are interested in the limit 
$T_1 \rightarrow \infty, T_2 \rightarrow \infty,  T_2-T_1 \rightarrow \infty,$ however
\begin{equation}
T_2 - T_1  \ll T_1. 
\label{eq:inter}
\end{equation}
Because of Equation~\ref{eq:inter}, we can consider  $\ln (t)$  to be effectively constant over  the interval.
The latter condition is not essential but is convenient, in that it simplifies the numerical work. 
The notation $\ln (t)$ stands for the natural logarithm of $t$.  
We study the probability distribution function for $Z(t)$ at generalized Gram  points,
 $p_{\phi}(y)$:
\begin{definition}\label{pphi}
\begin{equation}
\int\limits_{a}^{b} p_{\phi}(z)dz
\label{eq:pdfphi}
\end{equation}
is the probability that $a<Z(t)<b$ when we consider the values of $Z(t)$ for a large number of 
generalized Gram points in the sample space. 
\end{definition}
The probability density  $p_{\phi}(z)$ depends on the sample space (i.e., on the height $t$ and on the size of 
the sample space). In practice the densities are not sensitive to the choice of the sample space as long as 
the height $t$ is large enough and the length of the interval from which the sample is collected is large enough 
(but not too large on log scale). The emphasis in this work is on the empirical study of the distribution. 
There are important open theoretical questions about the distribution that we do not cover, 
and we mention those questions in the Appendix.

The universality relation is
\begin{equation}
p_{\phi}(z) = A(z)\cos(\phi) + B(z)\cos(2\phi) +C(z),
\label{eq:universality}
\end{equation}
where $A(z)$, $B(z)$ and $C(z)$ are universal functions, i.e., they do not depend on $\phi$. 
The anti-symmetry relation is
\begin{equation}
p_{\phi}(z) = p_{\phi+\pi}(-z).
\label{eq:rhoantisym}
\end{equation}
The symmetry relation is
\begin{equation}
p_{\phi}(z) = p_{2\pi-\phi}(z).
\label{eq:rhosym}
\end{equation}

We estimated $A(z)$, $B(z)$ and $C(z)$ by fitting Eq.~\ref{eq:universality} to the actual
probability densities for several values of $z$ and $\phi$. Table~\ref{tab:coefficients} gives the 
fitted values 
of the universal functions.
Fig~\ref{z05} and Fig.~\ref{z00} and Table~\ref{tab:pred} show the comparison of the predictions 
from the universality 
relation to the actual probability densities, for some values of the argument $z$.

From the symmetry relations Eq.~\ref{eq:rhosym} and Eq.~\ref{eq:rhosym} we find 
that the function 
$A(z)$ has to be anti-symmetric in $z$, and $B(z)$ and $C(z)$ have to be symmetric in $z$.
Table~\ref{tab:coefficients} confirms these properties. The figures, and 
Table~\ref{tab:pred} show the excellent agreement of the actual probability densities with the
universality relations prediction.

We briefly mention other studies of the value distribution of the Riemann zeta function and 
the closely related Hardy's function~\cite{Hardy 1918}.  Ivi\'c's monograph~\cite{Ivic 2013} has a comprehensive survey of  the field.
Selberg in unpublished work showed that at large $t$ $\log (\zeta(\frac{1}{2} + it))$ is approximately normally distributed with a standard deviation of order $\sqrt{log~log~t}$ (see Ref.~\cite{Hejhal}). He showed a 
similar result~\cite{Selberg 1989, Selberg 1991} for $\log (|Z(t)|)$. Laurincikas~\cite{Laurincikas}  used probabilistic number theory to prove various results about the distribution of the Riemann zeta function.

\subsection{\label{related}Related work}

Regarding the value distribution at specific points along the Gram interval, 
Titchmarsh~\cite{Titchmarsh 1934} and Kalpokas and Steuding~\cite{kalpokas 2009} present 
results pertaining to the
mean value of the Riemann zeta function. Lester's~\cite{Lester 2013} Ph. D. thesis also 
considers the distribution of $\log (|\zeta(\frac{1}{2} + it)|)$  for specific points along the Gram interval.  
The question of the values of Hardy's $Z$-function at a discrete sequence of points on the critical axis 
is quite interesting. The above references give some results in this direction that can be proved rigorously. 
At the same time, the present state of Riemann zeta function theory gives limited information 
about the value distribution of $Z(t)$ at discrete sequences of points. Possibly, these analogues 
could differ significantly from the continuous case.  
Our numerical studies of the value distribution of Hardy's $Z$-function at discrete points
helps fill the gaps. 


\subsection{\label{numerics}Numerical evaluation}


Hardy's function $Z(t)$  is evaluated using the Riemann$-$Siegel series
\begin{equation}
Z(t) = 2\sum^{m}_{n=1}\frac{\cos(\theta(t) - t \ln (n))}{\sqrt{n}} + R(t), 
\label{eq:RS}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the integer part of $\sqrt{t/(2\pi)}$. $R(t)$ is a small remainder
term which can be evaluated to the desired level of accuracy. We used the techniques in
 Refs.~\cite{Odlyzko 1992,hiary,gourdon} 
to efficiently evaluate the zeta function at large $t$. To evaluate  $Z(t)$  at several points 
in the Gram interval, we have to use band limited function interpolation~\cite{Jerri 1977}. 
We evaluate the coefficients in the series for band limited function interpolation at the Gram points, 
and use the series to evaluate $Z(t)$ at other points in the Gram interval. The most important 
source for loss of accuracy at large heights is the cancellation between
large numbers that occur in the arguments of the $\cos$ terms in Eq.~(\ref{eq:RS}). We 
use a high precision module to evaluate the arguments. The rest of the calculation
is done using regular double precision accuracy. The  zeros from Ref~\cite{hiary 2010} 
were used 
to check the accuracy of our zeta function calculations. 
Our evaluations of $Z(t)$ at $T=10^{12}$ 
are accurate 
to better than $10^{-6}$. 


\section{\label{sec4}Quantiles}
  
The human mind is attracted by symmetry. Many objects in nature exhibit symmetry.
Even more remarkable are the symmetries exhibited in the basic laws of the 
universe. In this section we present  numerical evidence for the symmetry properties
Eq.~\ref{eq:rhosym} and Eq.~\ref{eq:rhoantisym}. 
We  present the distribution for $T=10^{12}$, followed by the distribution for $T=10^{28}$.  
We are interested in how the symmetry properties behave when we span a large range of 
height $T$.
We will present the symmetry properties in terms of the quantiles~\cite{feller} 
for the sample space. This is because for any sample space the quantiles are well defined 
and always exist. We recall that in statistics, given a fraction $f$ between $0$ and $1$, 
the quantile $q_f$ is the value such that fraction $f$  of the sample population is 
at or below $q_f$. For example, $q_{0.5}$ is the median of the sample.
For $f$ very close to $0$ or $1$, in the limiting case $q_f$ will diverge. 
However we will assume that there is a range of $f$ for which well-defined limits exist. 
If necessary we can normalize the $Z$ values by some power of $\ln(T/2\pi)$ without 
affecting the symmetry properties. Since the standard deviation is 
known to be $sqrt(\ln(T/2\pi))$~\cite{Shanker 2018b}, 
normalizing $Z$ by this factor will make $q_f$ finite for finite $f$. 
Certainly, for our two samples separated by several orders of magnitude, 
we find that the quantile distribution changes very little. 

In terms of quantiles the anti-symmetry relation Eq.~\ref{eq:rhoantisym} 
can be written
\begin{equation}
q_{f}(\phi) = -q_{1-f}(\pi-\phi).
\label{eq:antisym}
\end{equation}
Eq.~\ref{eq:antisym}  is a generalization of the result in Ref.~\cite{Shanker 2018a} 
for the anti-symmetry of the distribution of $Z(t)$ at even and odd Gram points. 
The  symmetry condition is
\begin{equation}
q_{f}(\phi) = q_{f}(2\pi-\phi).
\label{eq:sym}
\end{equation}

\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:mean12} shows the mean value for $Z(T)$ and the standard deviation at $12$ equally spaced values of $\phi$ at $T=10^{12}$. The mean value is known from theory to be $2\cos(\phi)$, and the standard deviation is known to be $sqrt(\ln(T/2\pi))$~\cite{Shanker 2018b}. The table verifies this result to better than one part in a thousand. Table~\ref{tab:quantiles12} shows the quantiles for $Z(T)$. Eq.~\ref{eq:antisym} can be verified, for example, by noting that $q_f$ in Table~\ref{tab:quantiles12}
for $\phi=\pi/6$ and $f=0.25$ is $0.017$, while it is $-0.016$ for $\phi=5\pi/6$ and $f=0.75$. Eq.~\ref{eq:sym} can be verified, for example, by noting that $q_f$ is $0.018$ for $\phi=11\pi/6$ and $f=0.25$.

We found that there is a linear dependence of the quantiles on $\cos(\phi)$. 
Table~\ref{tab:fit12} shows the intercept and slope when $q_f$ for any $f$ is fitted to
$2\cos(\phi))$. The observation of this relation itself verifies the symmetry condition 
Eq.~\ref{eq:sym} (i.e., there is no dependence on $\sin(\phi)$). 
The anti-symmetry condition Eq.~\ref{eq:antisym} implies that the intercept is anti-symmetric 
for reflection around $f=0.5$, while the slope is symmetric for such a reflection. This can be verified from the table. Table~\ref{tab:fit12} makes the symmetry and anti-symmetry relations stand out clearly.  It must be pointed out that Eq.~\ref{eq:antisym} and Eq.~\ref{eq:sym} do not require the
existence of the linear relationship of $q_f$ to $\cos(\phi)$. However, the linear relationship is consistent with the symmetry relations.
The linear dependence and the symmetry properties imply that the quartile range $q_{1-f}-q_f$ is independent of $\phi$.

To perform a rigorous test of the symmetry relations, we repeat the study for another $T$ separated from the first sample by $16$ orders of magnitude. At $T=10^{28}$ we used the  zeros from Ref~\cite{hiary 2010} to get the coefficients in the series for band limited function interpolation. We could then use this series to evaluate  $Z(t)$  at several points in the Gram interval.
Table~\ref{tab:mean28} shows the mean value for $Z(T)$  and the standard deviation at $12$ equally spaced values of $\phi$ at $T=10^{28}$. The table verifies that the values are $2\cos(\phi)$, to a few parts in a thousand. Table~\ref{tab:quantiles28} shows the quantiles for $Z(T)$.  Eq.~\ref{eq:antisym} can be verified, for example, by noting that $q_f$ in Table~\ref{tab:quantiles28}
for $\phi=\pi/6$ and $f=0.25$ is $-0.135$, while it is $0.134$ for $\phi=5\pi/6$ and $f=0.75$. Eq.~\ref{eq:sym} can be verified, for example, by noting that $q_f$ is $-0.133$ for $\phi=11\pi/6$ and $f=0.25$. Table~\ref{tab:fit28} verifies the linear relationship of $q_f$ to $\cos(\phi)$. The anti-symmetry condition Eq.~\ref{eq:antisym}  and the symmetry condition Eq.~\ref{eq:sym} are also verified in the table.


\section{\label{conclusions}Conclusions}

The most exciting new result is the discovery of a universality relation for the 
value distribution of the Hardy Z function at discrete points. Eq.~\ref{eq:universality}
states the universality relations. Table~\ref{tab:coefficients} gives the fitted values 
of the universal functions.
Fig~\ref{z05} and Fig.~\ref{z00} show the comparison of the predictions from the universality 
relation to the actual probability densities, for some values of the argument $z$. The figures, and 
Table~\ref{tab:pred} show the excellent agreement of the actual probability densities with the
universality relations prediction.
The evidence for the anti-symmetry and symmetry properties 
in terms of quantiles is illuminating. 
It is noteworthy that the quantile distributions change very little 
when the height $T$ spans $16$ orders of magnitude. 
Another intriguing observation is the linear dependence of the quantiles 
on $\cos(\phi)$. The linear dependence and the symmetry properties imply that 
the quartile range $q_{1-f}-q_f$ is independent of $\phi$.

\section*{\label{appendix} Appendix}

A more precise definition for the function $p_{\phi}(y)$ is provided. We consider the interval along 
the critical axis specified by $(T_1, T_2)$. While empirical studies necessarily use large but 
finite  $T_1, T_2$, we are interested in the limit 
$T_1 \rightarrow \infty, T_2 \rightarrow \infty,  T_2-T_1 \rightarrow \infty,$ however
\begin{equation}
T_2 - T_1  \ll T_1. 
\label{eq:interval}
\end{equation}
Because of Equation \ref{eq:interval}, we can consider  $\ln (t)$  to be effectively constant over  the interval. A probability space $W$ is defined by a sample space of elementary events $\Omega$, a $\sigma$ algebra of all considered events $\mathcal{F}$, and a probability measure $P$. Our space of elementary events $\Omega$ is the set of all generalized Gram points with value phi in the interval. This is easily seen to be a discrete space. If we denote $\theta (T_1) = 2k_1\pi + \phi$, $\theta (T_2) = 2k_2\pi + \phi$, then we can index the set of generalized Gram points in the interval by the integer  $k$, where $k$ lies in the interval $(k_1, k_2)$. Since the mean spacing $\delta$ of the zeros at height $t$ is $\delta = 2\pi(\ln (t/2\pi))^{-1}$, the cardinality of this set is $(T_2 - T_1)*(\ln (T_1/2\pi))/(2\pi)$. Since we are dealing with a discrete space, we follow standard practice and choose $\mathcal{F}$,  the  $\sigma$ algebra, to be the collection of all subsets of $\Omega$ . Finally, the random variable whose probability distribution we wish to study is the value of $Z(t)$ at the generalized Gram point $t$.


We can get some insight into the probability distribution $p_{\phi}(z)$ from the studies of 
Kalpokas and Steuding \cite{kalpokas 2009}. 
They show that for $\phi_1$ in the range $[0, \pi)$ 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{0 < t < T, \zeta(\frac{1}{2}+it) \in e^{i\phi_1}\mathbb{R}} \zeta(\frac{1}{2}+it) = (2e^{i\phi_1}\cos(\phi_1))\frac{T}{2\pi}\ln (\frac{T}{2\pi}) + O_\epsilon(T^{(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}).
\label{eq:kalpokas1}
\end{equation}
From Equation~\ref{eq:kalpokas1} and the cardinality of our sample space, it follows that a finite mean can be defined for the value distribution in our sample space. This gives support to the existence of a limiting distribution. We now consider the possibility of defining higher order moments for the value distribution. Kalpokas and Steuding  also show that
\begin{equation}
\sum_{0 < t < T, \zeta(\frac{1}{2}+it) \in e^{i\phi_1}\mathbb{R}} |\zeta(\frac{1}{2}+it)|^2 = \frac{T}{2\pi}(\ln (\frac{T}{2\pi}))^2 + (2\gamma+2\cos(2\phi_1))\frac{T}{2\pi}\ln (\frac{T}{2\pi}) + \frac{T}{2\pi} + O_\epsilon(T^{(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}),
\label{eq:kalpokas2}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is Euler's constant. From Equation~\ref{eq:kalpokas2} and the cardinality of our sample space 
it seems that higher order moments of the value distribution diverge logarithmically. 
There is a lot of cancellation between positive and negative values of $Z(T)$ for odd moments, 
so odd moments will  behave better than even moments. It seems likely that a limiting value distribution exists, 
it has a finite well-defined mean, and higher moments diverge logarithmically. 
Distributions which do not have all moments defined are used in applications, for example, 
the Cauchy-Lorentz distribution~\cite{feller}. Equation~\ref{eq:kalpokas1} and \ref{eq:kalpokas2} 
predict that the standard deviation should be independent of $\phi$. 
These equations also imply that the probability distribution will have a finite standard deviation if the 
argument is normalized by $\sqrt{\frac{T}{2\pi}}$.
