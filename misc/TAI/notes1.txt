Our application of the Transformer model, renowned for its attention mechanisms in natural language processing, marks a significant breakthrough in predicting the distribution of Riemann zeta zero counts on consecutive Gram intervals. Achieving accuracies as high as $0.998$ in forecasting sequences of ten consecutive zero counts underscores the model's robustness and effectiveness in this specialized domain. By focusing on rare events — intervals with three or more zeros — and employing tailored training strategies, we achieved near-perfect predictions, showcasing the Transformer's adaptability beyond traditional linguistic tasks. Moreover, our study demonstrates promising potential for applying these techniques to more intricate problems, leveraging minimal computational resources compared to standard language models. With enhanced computational capabilities, we anticipate tackling even more impactful challenges, highlighting the transformative impact of advanced AI methodologies in mathematical research and beyond.
