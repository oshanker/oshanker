We present a new hitherto unknown symmetry in the value
distribution of the characteristic polynomial of the Circular Unitary Ensemble (CUE)
 at discrete points. This is significant because the symmetry properties
are fundamental aspects of a system. We show that the value distribution 
can be expressed in terms of three functions 
which do not depend on the angle characterizing the Generalized Gram point.
These relationships are very similar to those  observed for 
the Riemann zeta function.

\section{Introduction}

Inspired by striking new results found for the value distribution of the Riemann zeta function,
we searched for similar results for the Circular Unitary Ensemble (CUE)
at discrete points. We did the study because of the well-known correspondence between the
zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the eigenvalues of Random Matrix Theory (RMT).
In particular we present a symmetry property and an anti-symmetry property for the value
distribution of the characteristic polynomial of the CUE. We show that the value distribution 
can be expressed in terms of three  functions 
which do not depend on the angle characterizing the Generalized Gram point. These results
are new, and have not been reported for the CUE system earlier.

RMT has found applications~\cite{KeatingSnaith 2000,Odlyzko 1992} 
in many areas of physics, mathematics,  probability, statistics, and engineering. 
 RMT is closely associated with the study of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function 
 and Generalized Zeta functions. The zeros are of interest to mathematicians and physicists. 
Mathematicians 
study the spacings because of its applications to analytic number theory, 
while physicists study it because of its  relation 
to the theory of the spectra of random matrix theories 
and the spectra of classically chaotic quantum systems.
Ref.~\cite{Chhaibi 2014} shows that the characteristic polynomial 
of the CUE has a limiting form when properly rescaled. 
See Ref.~\cite{Francesco 2007,os6, Hanga 2020} for  further references,
examples and discussion. 
 Ref.~\cite{KeatingSnaith 2000} shows that the CUE provides
a good model for the moments and other properties of the $|\zeta(1/2 + it)|$.

We were motivated to do the current study because of almost identical 
properties observed
for the Riemann zeta function and Dirichlet $L$ functions. 
Ref.~\cite{Shanker 2018a,Shanker 2018b} studied empirically 
the distribution of $Z(t)$ values 
at Gram points and showed  that  the  value
distribution of the Hardy $Z$ function at discrete points is anti-symmetrical for 
reflections around the mid-points of the Gram intervals (Eq.~\ref{eq:Rieantisym}) 
and symmetrical for reflections around the Gram points(Eq.~\ref{eq:Riesym}). 
Ref.~\cite{Shanker 2020} showed that the value distribution of the Riemann zeta function 
can be expressed in terms of three  functions 
 which do not depend on the angle characterizing the Generalized Gram point. 




\section{\label{sec2}Materials and Methods}

\subsection{\label{seckaratsuba}Karatsuba Problem}


\subsection{\label{secwhy}Why Machine Learning?}

In this section we  establish the required notation for the 
Riemann Zeta Function. This will help us to define the
corresponding quantities for the CUE characteristic polynomial.
For $\mathrm{Re} (s) > 1$ the Riemann Zeta function is defined as
\begin{equation}
\zeta ( s ) \, = \, \sum^{\infty}_{n = 1} \; n^{-s} \, = \, \prod_{p \in primes} \;
\left( 1 - p^{-s} \right)^{-1}.
\label{eqRie}
\end{equation}
 $\zeta ( s )$ can be continued to
the complex plane. Riemann's hypothesis, that the non-trivial zeros of $\zeta ( s )$ lie on the 
critical axis $1/2+it$, is probably the most famous unsolved problem in mathematics.
The mean spacing $\delta$ of the zeros  at large height $T$ is $\delta = 2\pi(\ln (T/2\pi))^{-1}$. 
One defines Hardy's function
\begin{equation}
Z(t)=exp(i\theta_{Riemann}(t))\zeta(1/2 +it) 
\label{eq:hardy}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\theta_{Riemann}(t) = arg (\pi^{it/2} \Gamma(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{it}{2})). 
\label{eq:theta}
\end{equation}
We use the subscript in $\theta_{Riemann}$ to differentiate this $\theta$ from the 
one which occurs in the study of the CUE matrices.
The argument in Eq.~\ref{eq:theta} is defined by continuous variation of $t$ 
starting with the value $0$ at $t = 0$.
$Z(t)$ is real valued for real $t$,
and we have $|Z(t)| = |\zeta(1/2+it)|$. Thus the zeros of $Z(t)$ are the 
imaginary part of the zeros 
of $\zeta(s)$ which lie on the critical line.  

Gram points play an important role in the the theory because many of the 
zeros are separated by them.  
When $t \ge 7$, the $\theta$ function Eq.(\ref{eq:theta}) is monotonic increasing. 
For $n \ge -1$, the $n$-th Gram point $g_n$ is defined as the unique solution $> 7$ to
$\theta_{Riemann} (g_n) = n\pi$. A Gram interval is the interval $G_n = [g_n,g_{n+1})$.
 In analogy with Gram points, we can associate an angle $\phi$ with a point $t$ on the 
 critical axis as follows:
\begin{definition}\label{phi}
For $t \ge 7$, $t$ is said to be a generalized Gram point with value $\phi$  if
$\theta_{Riemann} (t) = 2k\pi + \phi$, where $0 \le \phi < 2\pi$.
\end{definition}
We define the probability distribution function for $Z(t)$ at generalized Gram  points
 $p_{\phi}(y)$:
\begin{definition}\label{pphi}
\begin{equation}
\int\limits_{a}^{b} p_{\phi}(z)dz
\label{eq:pdfphi}
\end{equation}
is the probability that $a<Z(t)<b$ when we consider the values of $Z(t)$ 
for a large number of 
generalized Gram points in the sample space. 
\end{definition}

It is known (Ref.~\cite{Shanker 2018b}) that the average value of the 
$Z$ distribution is $2cos(\phi)$ where $\phi$
is the angle characterizing the Generalized Gram point. We have also shown
(Ref.~\cite{Shanker 2020}) that the probability distributions
satisfy the anti-symmetry relation 
\begin{equation}
p_{\phi}(z) = p_{\phi+\pi}(-z)
\label{eq:Rieantisym}
\end{equation}
and the symmetry relation is
\begin{equation}
p_{\phi}(z) = p_{2\pi-\phi}(z).
\label{eq:Riesym}
\end{equation}
Ref.~\cite{Shanker 2020} showed 
that the probability distributions at different $\phi$ can all be expressed in
terms of three functions which are independent of $\phi$ and depend only on $z$.
These are the observations which we wanted to model using the CUE. For generating the
CUE samples for the study we extend the programs and results of Ref.~\cite{Francesco 2007}.

\section{\label{sec3}Results}

\subsection{\label{sec3.1} Symmetry relations for CUE}

The question of the values of the characteristic polynomial of a CUE matrix 
at a discrete sequence of points is quite interesting. 
Today we have limited information 
about the value distribution of the characteristic polynomial at discrete sequences of points. 
Possibly, these analogues could differ significantly from the continuous case. 
In this section we present our numerical studies. The results provide very good evidence 
for two new symmetry properties. Since the Riemann zeta studies were done at a
height $T = 10^{28}$, we use the well-known correspondence $N \thicksim \ln(T/2\pi)$ where $N$ 
is the size of the unitary matrix we should consider. Thus, we chose $N = 63$ for our
study. We studied $10000$ sample $U$ to generate the distributions.

The characteristic polynomial can be written as
\begin{align}
\Lambda(U, \theta) = det(I-U\exp^{-i\theta})\\
                   = \prod_{n}(1-\exp^{i(\theta_{n} - \theta)}).
\label{eq:cueDet}
\end{align}
This expression simplifies to
\begin{align}
\Lambda(U, \theta)  = 2^N\exp^{i(3N\pi/2 + \sum_{n}\theta_{n}/2 - N\theta/2)}\prod_{n}\sin((\theta_{n} - \theta)/2).
\label{eq:cueExpanded}
\end{align}
In analogy with the $Z$ in the Riemann zeta case, we can identify a $Z_{CUE}$ by defining
\begin{align}
Z_{CUE}(\theta))    = \exp^{-i(3N\pi/2 + \sum_{n}\theta_{n}/2 - N\theta/2)}\Lambda(U, \theta)\\
                    = 2^N\prod_{n}\sin((\theta_{n} - \theta)/2).
\label{eq:cueZ}
\end{align}
$Z_{CUE}(\theta))$ is real valued,
and we have $|Z_{CUE}(\theta)| = |\Lambda(U, \theta)|$. The analogue of the Riemann zeta 
Gram points occurs when $\Lambda(U, \theta)$ is real, i.e., 
$(3N\pi/2 + \sum_{n}\theta_{n}/2 - N\theta/2) = m\pi$.
We call $\theta$  a CUE generalized Gram point with value $\phi$  if
$(3N\pi/2 + \sum_{n}\theta_{n}/2 - N\theta/2) = 2k\pi + \phi$, where $0 \le \phi < 2\pi$.
For a given $\phi$, we have $N$ distinct CUE generalized Gram points spaced uniformly
around the unit circle.
The definition for the probability distribution is analogous to the Riemann zeta definition.

The CUE probability distributions satisfy (see Fig.~\ref{z1},~\ref{z2},~\ref{z3},~\ref{z4}) 
the anti-symmetry relation 
\begin{equation}
p_{\phi}(z) = p_{\phi+\pi}(-z)
\label{eq:antisym}
\end{equation}
and the symmetry relation 
\begin{equation}
p_{\phi}(z) = p_{2\pi-\phi}(z).
\label{eq:sym}
\end{equation}
We also found  (see Table~\ref{tab:mean12}) that the average value of the 
distribution is $2cos(\phi)$ where $\phi$
is the angle characterizing the CUE generalized Gram point, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
<z>_{\phi} = 2\cos(\phi).
\label{eq:cosphi}
\end{equation}
Thus, we reproduce the behaviour 
for the Riemann zeta case.

\subsection{\label{relation}Relations for distributions at different $\phi$}



For the Riemann zeta probability distributions, we found~\cite{Shanker 2020}
that the probability distributions at different $\phi$ can all be expressed in
terms of three functions which are independent of $\phi$ and depend only on $z$.
We show that such a relation holds for the CUE distributions also.
This is a very intriguing direction to probe more deeply.

The universality relation is
\begin{equation}
p_{\phi}(z) = A(z) + B(z)\cos(\phi) +C(z)\cos(2\phi),
\label{eq:universality}
\end{equation}
where $A(z)$, $B(z)$ and $C(z)$ are  functions which do not depend on $\phi$. 
We estimated $A(z)$, $B(z)$ and $C(z)$ by fitting Eq.~\ref{eq:universality} to the actual
probability densities for several values of $z$ and $\phi$. 
Fig~\ref{z05} and Fig.~\ref{z00} show the comparison of the predictions 
from the universality 
relation to the actual probability densities, for some values of the argument $z$.
We find that the function 
$B(z)$ is anti-symmetric in $z$, and $A(z)$ and $C(z)$ are symmetric in $z$, which 
leads to Eq.~\ref{eq:sym} and Eq.~\ref{eq:antisym}.
The figures show the excellent agreement of the actual probability densities with the
universality relations prediction.


\section{\label{conclusions}Conclusions}

We discovered new anti-symmetry and symmetry properties 
for the value distribution of the CUE characteristic polynomial at discrete points. 
We presented a simple relation for the average value 
of the  distribution. We showed that the value distribution 
can be expressed in terms of three  functions 
 which do not depend on the angle characterizing the Generalized Gram point. 
These relations are very similar to the relations observed for 
the Riemann zeta function.
